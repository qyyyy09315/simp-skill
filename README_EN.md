## Two Styles, Switch Anytime

### 💖 Pure Love Mode
No tactics. No games. Lead with genuine feeling. Best for emotionally expressive crushes, or when you just want to be real.

> *"When you smiled like that, I suddenly didn't want to talk anymore. I just wanted to look a little longer."*

### 🎯 Strategic Mode
Know when to advance, when to pause, and how to let the interaction progress naturally. Best for analytical crushes or when things have stalled.

> *"What you said earlier, I've been thinking about it."* (leave space for them to respond)

```bash
/simp timeline emma

## Crisis Playbook

- **C-1** Explicit rejection → How to accept gracefully + when to try again
- **C-2** Sudden silence / left on read → Observation window + re-entry messages
- **C-3** Gradual drift apart → Give space + change interaction style
- **C-4** Friend-zoned → Three-step breakout method
- **C-5** Said something wrong → 6-24 hour repair framework
- **C-6** Rival appeared → Differentiated value strategy
- **C-7** Confession left hanging → Waiting period strategy
- **C-8** Stuck in the ambiguous zone → Three respectful ways to find a breakthrough
- **C-9** Misunderstanding / argument → Repair script framework

## Signal Scoring System

The chat analyzer scores your crush's behavior across 6 dimensions:

| Dimension | Max Points |
|-----------|-----------|
| Initiative (who starts conversations) | 6 |
| Reply speed | 5 |
| Reply speed trend (getting faster?) | 3 |
| Message length (emotional investment) | 3 |
| Late-night messages (intimacy signal) | 5 |
| Follow-up questions (engagement) | 3 |
| **Total** | **25** |

Score interpretation:
- **18-25**: 🟢🟢🟢 Strong green light — time to confess
- **12-17**: 🟢🟡 Moderate interest — deepen the connection
- **6-11**: 🟡 Ambiguous — keep observing
- **0-5**: 🟡🔴 Weak signals — build foundation first
- **< 0**: 🔴 Warning signals — reassess strategy

## Design Principles

1. **Authenticity over tactics** — All strategy is grounded in real feeling
2. **Specificity over templates** — Generated messages embed real details from your relationship
3. **Respect their choices** — If they clearly say no, we help you let go gracefully
4. **Local data only** — Chat logs are analyzed locally, never uploaded anywhere
5. **No manipulation** — Zero PUA tactics, zero gaslighting, zero pressure games

## For Myself, and for You

In this vast world, some people only pass through once.

Some things go unsaid — not because you didn't want to say them, but because you didn't know how. And by the time you did, some people were already gone.

Rethy, I still miss you.

---

## A Final Word

When I built this, I wasn't thinking about how to win someone over.

I was thinking about how many people carry a feeling they never find the words for. Not because they don't care — but because they don't know how to show it. Not because the love isn't there — but because it never quite reaches the other person.

This tool can help you say what you mean. It can help you read the room, and hand you a lifeline when things go sideways. But there is one thing it cannot do: feel something for you. That part has always been, and will only ever be, yours.

Loving someone is a capacity, not just a skill. Skills can be learned from a playbook. Capacity is different — it asks you to show up, to get it wrong, to lie awake one night thinking of someone and not know what to do, and then, slowly, figure it out.

Everyone needs to be loved differently. Some people need to hear the words. Some need to see the actions. Some need you to stay; some need you to know when to give them space. Nobody is born knowing how.

If this project helps you understand someone a little better, or say something you couldn't find the courage for — that's enough.

Whether it works out is a separate question entirely.

Learning to love — that's the real thing this is about.
